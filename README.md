# quora-insincere-questions
Trying some baseline approaches and deep learning to classify Quora's insincere questions from sincere ones.

## Dataset
[Quora Insincere Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincerequestions-classification/data)

## Approaches Used
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression Classifier
- Decision Trees
- LightGBM (Gradient Boosting)
- Convolutional Neural Networks

> LightGBM seems to be similar (or better) to XGBoost but faster.


There are two separate notebooks for Deep learning approach and non-deep learning approach.

Output of notebooks is not seen on github so I have included kaggle's notebook link below:

> Note: Work still on progress
